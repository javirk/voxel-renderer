# Voxel Renderer - WGPU

A simple voxel renderer. The model is embedded in a 3D texture, and I use ray marching to find intersections. It's simple, but as fast as a voxel renderer can be.

No OBJ handling, just a texture. Usability is not the best, but this is meant to be used for another project, so not important at the moment.
